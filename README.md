Random Quote Generator
Treehouse's Fullstack JavaScript Techdegree Project One. 
Treehouse provided the HTML and CSS. I used JavaScript to generate a random quote 
and output it to the HTML. Quotes will not appear twice until all quotes in the array have been called. 
Additionally, a new quote appears every 15 seconds.
I wrote the Javascript code.
